WRITTEN REPORT:

This analysis begins with an overall summary for the district data and then breaks the data down by schools within the district.  This breakdown shows school type, number of students, budgets, and average test scores for each school.  Next, the highest-performing and lowest-performing schools are identified.  Then, math and reading scores are broken down by grade. Finally, scores are broken down by school spending, school size, and school type.

This analysis shows there are 7 District schools and 8 Charter schools in this district.  All 5 of the top performing schools are Charter schools, with a 90.4% overall passing rate, and all 5 of the bottom performing schools are District schools, with a 53.7% overall passing rate.  School size may be a contributing factor to consider.

When schools are grouped by size, there is a similar drop with large schools (2000-5000 students), which have a 58.3% overall passing rate.  Comparitively, small schools (<1000 students) and medium schools (1000-2000 students) have 89.9% and 90.6% passing rates respectively.

All 7 of the District schools are large (2000-5000 students), while only 1 of the 8 Charter schools is large (2000-5000 students).  When you look at the overall passing rates for the large District schools, the range is 53-54%; however, the large Charter school maintained a 91% overall passing rate.  This supports the idea that size may not be a major factor in the difference between passing rates for District and Charter schools.

When assessing budgets per student by school type, there were no significant differences between the two. District schools averaged $643.57 per student and Charter schools averaged $599.50 per student.  Additional analysis may be needed to assess which factors impact the drop in passing rates in District schools, as budget and size did not appear to make a significant difference.
